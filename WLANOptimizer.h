/**
    OptimizeWLAN()

    Optimize WiFi settings for low-latency.

    ***************************************************************
    * This function takes about 1 second to execute.
    * This settings change resets when the app closes.
    * This can only change WiFi adapters with an active connection.
    * This settings change resets if the WiFi adapter reconnects.
    ***************************************************************

    Note: This settings change DOES NOT require that the application has
    Administrator access (e.g. no need to elevate with UAC), but it does
    require that the logged-in user has an attached Administrator token
    (e.g. they could elevate with UAC if they wanted to).

    This fixes a common issue on Windows laptops where the adapter scans for
    networks while a connection is active, causing 100+ millisecond delays.
    This makes a huge difference in performance for real-time multiplayer!

    enable: Set to 1 to enable the optimizations.
    Set to 0 to disable the optimizations when finished.

    Returns OptimizeWLAN_Success on success.
    Returns other values on failure.

    If it returns OptimizeWLAN_NoConnections then the application may want
    to try again later when a connection is available.  This can also be
    used to check when a connection becomes available.

/**
    StartWLANOptimizerThread()

    Running OptimizeWLAN() in a thread solves all the edge cases:

    (1) OptimizeWLAN() takes 1 second to run, so this avoids blocking anything.
    (2) If WiFi reconnects the settings are lost and must be reapplied.
    (3) If WiFi connects for the first time after app start, this will catch it.

    This is a background thread that runs the WLANOptimizer every 11 seconds.
    If we see some kind of lag spike every 11 seconds this might be the culprit.

    The goal is to keep refreshing the WiFi settings that disable background
    scanning and enable media streaming mode, so that if the app starts and no
    WiFi connection is available initially, or if WiFi goes down and connects
    again while the app is running, the app will continue to have low latency.

    It runs in a background thread because the function takes 1 second to run.
    This is how I'm using WLANOptimizer in my own netcode.
