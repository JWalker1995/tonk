WORK IN PROGRESS

This is going to take a while as I'm still investigating the feasibility and scope.

Notes:
+ 64-bit integers are not allowed so we need to clip the timestamps

FFI:

NAN:
+ It takes 25 lines of C++ code to add a float vector with nodejs addon

NodeJS interface is probably for servers only, and only for JSON datatypes?
Perhaps the API can be simplified greatly so that only the core features are exposed.
