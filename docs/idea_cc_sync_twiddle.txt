Idea: Replace timestamp bit with a CC sync twiddle bit.

Time sync message contains new CC parameters and twiddle bit value.
Sender side sets outgoing twiddle bit to the new one.

Receiver side waits for the new twiddle bit value to evaluate changes in CC settings.

Advantages:

More robust to micro-changes in latency.
More robust to edge cases where a bin straddles two CC parameters.
Prevents CC from running ahead of actual measurements.

Disadvantages:

Lose optional timestamp bit.
Complexity?
Does not help for ramp patterns only CC parameters held constant for "a while."
Implicitly tied to the RTT of the channel.

Discussion on using a new field instead of a new bit:

Adding another field would cost at least two bytes per packet.
It would require a lot more processing to decode the meaning of the field.
