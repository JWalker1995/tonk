TODO?

+ If there's room in the last packet we're going to send in a flush, attach recovery data there a bit sooner

+ Steal bits from length field for Siamese recovery metadata

+ Siamese decoder should deallocate data even if no recovery packets are sent

+ Key agreement protocol using Curve25519

+ Encrypt with NORX

+ Unreliable but ordered based on nonce

+ Other types of CC (delay based, no-cc), selectable by config objects

+ Can we handle head loss detection more efficiently somehow?

+ TCP fallback on UDP handshake failure

+ Split transport components out into a middle library so that other UDP network library can be used underneath

+ Allow retransmits to be sent in the same packet as other data

+ MTU detection

+ Allow application to provide a list of target encoder rates so that Tonk can probe up with FEC without overusing the channel
